# Assignment-15 Working with Files and Streams in C#  
Involves the understanding of working with files and streams in C#.
## Task 1: Implement a File Data Processor
 Implement a program that reads data from a source file, perform some processing on the data, and write the processed data to a new file.
 1. Reads Data from a large file(created)
 2. Uses BufferedStream and FileStream
 3. Processes data read from file
 4. Writes processed data to a new file using MemoryStream

 ## Task 2:  Implement a File Data Processor with Asynchronous Methods
  Implemented a program that uses the asynchronous methods of the FileStream, MemoryStream, sand BufferedStream classes.
  1. Asynchronous versions of read,process and write methods.
  2. Compare synchronous vs asynchronous

## Task 3: Investigate Issues in Basic File usage.
  Implemented a program that fixes the starter code which has some inefficiencies.
  1. Identify issues
  2. Modify code to fix memory issues 

## Task 4:Analyze and Resolve Performance Issues with Logging System for Multiple Users.
  Improved the existing starter code to handle concurrent logging .
  1. Identify issues.
  2. Improve file writing.
  3. Independent error files.
