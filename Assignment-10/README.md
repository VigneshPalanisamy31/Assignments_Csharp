## 1. Explain what the .NET platform is and its primary purpose

The .NET platform is a **software development framework** that provides a runtime environment and tools for building and running applications.
It supports multiple programming languages like **C#, F#, VB.NET** and enables development of **desktop, web, cloud, gaming**, and more types of applications.

---

## 2. What are the key components of the .NET platform

### Main Components:

- **Common Language Runtime (CLR)**
- **Framework Class Library (FCL)**
- **Common Type System (CTS)**
- **Base Class Library (BCL)**
- **Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR)**

### Component Details:

- **Common Language Runtime (CLR)**
  Acts as a virtual machine that runs managed code. It handles memory management, security, thread execution, and more.

- **Framework Class Library (FCL)**
  Provides reusable classes, interfaces, and value types. It includes libraries for I/O, networking, collections, XML, and UI.

- **Common Type System (CTS)**
  Defines how data types are declared and used across languages. Ensures type safety and cross-language integration.
  Example: C#'s `int` and VB.NET's `Integer` both map to `System.Int32`.

- **Base Class Library (BCL)**
  A subset of FCL that includes core types such as `System.String`, `System.DateTime`, and `System.IO`. These are essential for everyday tasks.

- **Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR)**
  Adds support for dynamic languages (e.g., Python, Ruby) by allowing types to be resolved at runtime rather than compile-time.

## 3. Differentiate between the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and the Common Type System (CTS) in .NET

| Feature | CLR                                     | CTS                                                    |
| ------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Role    | Virtual machine that executes code      | Defines standard data types                            |
| Manages | Execution, memory, security, exceptions | Type definitions, conversions                          |
| Purpose | Run code and manage resources           | Enable cross-language interoperability                 |
| Example | Runs compiled assemblies                | Maps `int` in C# and `Integer` in VB to `System.Int32` |

## 4. What is the role of the Global Assembly Cache (GAC) in .NET

- **GAC** is a **machine-wide cache** that stores **shared assemblies**.
- Allows **multiple applications** to reuse the same version of a shared library.
- Prevents **version conflicts** and **duplicate deployments**.
- Assemblies in GAC must be **strongly named** with:

  - Name
  - Version
  - Culture (optional)
  - Public key token

### Deployment Options:

- Use an installer (e.g., MSI)
- Use `gacutil.exe` (developer tool)

---

## 5. Explain the difference between value types and reference types in C#

### Value Types

- Store the **actual data**.
- Allocated on the **stack**.
- Examples: `int`, `float`, `char`, `bool`, `enum`.

### Reference Types

- Store a **reference (address)** to data on the heap.
- Multiple variables can point to the **same object**.
- Examples: `string`, arrays, classes, delegates.

> Note: `string` is a reference type, but it's **immutable** — Any operation that appears to "change" a string (e.g., concatenation or reassignment) creates a new string object

---

## 6. Describe the concept of garbage collection on .NET and its advantages

- **Garbage Collection (GC)** is **automatic memory management** provided by CLR.
- Reclaims memory from objects no longer in use.

### Process:

1. **Marking** — Finds live (referenced) objects.
2. **Relocating** — Updates object references.
3. **Compacting** — Removes unused memory gaps.

### Generations:

- **Gen 0**: Short-lived (most frequently collected)
- **Gen 1**: Medium-lived
- **Gen 2**: Long-lived objects (e.g., static fields)

### Advantages:

* Prevents memory leaks
* Improves performance
* Reduces developer effort to manage memory

## 7. What is the purpose of the Globalization and Localization features in .NET

* **Globalization**: Designing apps to support **multiple cultures** (e.g., date formats, currency symbols, languages).
* **Localization**: Translating app resources (text, labels) into a **specific language/culture**.

> Example: `en-US` shows `$1,000.00`, while `fr-FR` shows `1 000,00 €`.

---

## 8. Explain the role of the Common Intermediate Language (CIL) and Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation in the .NET framework

* **CIL (Common Intermediate Language)**:
  Code compiled from C#, VB.NET, etc., is converted to CIL — a CPU-independent format.

* **JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation**:
  Converts CIL to **native machine code** at **runtime** for the target OS and hardware.

### Benefits:

* Platform independence
* Optimized runtime performance
* Code is verified and type-safe before execution
