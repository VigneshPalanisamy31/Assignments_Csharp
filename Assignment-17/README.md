# Assignment-17 Reflection in C# 
Involves the understanding and implementation of various aspects of Reflection in C#

### Task 1: Inspect Assembly Metadata
 Implemented a program that inspects the metadata of an assembly  
 1. Use the Assembly.LoadFile method to load the assembly. 
 2. Use the GetTypes method to get all the types in the assembly. 
 3. For each type, use the GetMethods, GetProperties, GetFields, and GetEvents methods to get the methods, properties, fields, and events respectively.

### Task 2: Dynamic Object Inspector
  Implemented a program that takes an object as input and display its properties and their current values.
  1. Create a class with a method that accepts an object as a parameter. 
  2. Display the name and current value of each property. 
  3. Implement a method that accepts a property name and a new value, and sets the property to the new value using the SetValue method.

### Task 3: Dynamic Method Invoker
  Implemented a method invoker that can call methods on an object dynamically, based on the method name provided as a string
  1. Create a class with a method that accepts an object and a string as parameters. 
  2. Get the type,methodinfo,call the Invoke method on the MethodInfo object to call the method on the object. 

### Task 4: Dynamic Type Builder
  Implemented a dynamic type builder that can define a new class at runtime, with properties and methods defined by the user. 
  1. Create an assembly and module using AssemblyBuilder and ModuleBuilder.  
  2. Use TypeBuilder to create a new type in the module.  
  3. Use DefineProperty and DefineMethod methods to add properties and methods to the type. 
  4. Use the CreateType method to create the type.  

 ### Task 5: Plugin SystemÂ 
   Implemented a plugin system for a simple application
  1. Define a common interface for plugins. 
  2. Create one or more plugins that implement the interface and compile them to .dll files.  
  3. Use Assembly.LoadFile to load each plugin assembly, use GetType and GetInterface methods to get types that implement the plugin interface. 
  4. Create instances of the plugin types and cast them to the plugin interface. 
  5. Call methods on the plugins through the plugin interface. 

 ### Task 6: Mocking Framework
    Implemented a program to dynamically generate a mock object
  1. Identify an interface that you want to mock and create a dynamic type that implements the interface.
  2. Declare a few Book records and display their details in the console.
  3. Use the TypeBuilder class from the System.Reflection.Emit namespace to define the new type. 
  4. Create an instance of your dynamic type and use it.

 ### Task 7: Serialization API
    Implement a simple serialization API using Reflection, and then identify its limitations and rewrite it using Reflection.Emit.
  1. Implement a simple serialization API using Reflection. 
  2. Rewrite your serialization API using Reflection.Emit. Use the System.Reflection.Emit namespace to generate dynamic methods for serialization.
